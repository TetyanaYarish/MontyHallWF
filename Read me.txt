Monty Hall Game Rules
The Monty Hall game, inspired by the classic game show "Let's Make a Deal," is a probability puzzle that involves a contestant, a host, and three doors. Here's how you play the Monty Hall game:

Objective
The objective of the game is to win the grand prize, which is hidden behind one of three doors.

Setup
There are three doors: Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3.
Behind one of these doors is the grand prize (e.g., a car).
Behind the other two doors are goats (or any other undesirable items).
Game Play
Initial Choice:

The contestant chooses one of the three doors. This is their initial choice.
Host's Action:

The host, who knows what's behind each door, will open one of the remaining two doors.
The host will always open a door that does not have the grand prize behind it (i.e., a goat).
Second Choice:

The contestant is given a choice to either stick with their initial choice or switch to the other unopened door.
Reveal:

The host then opens the door chosen by the contestant in the second choice to reveal whether the contestant has won the grand prize or a goat.
Strategy
Stick or Switch:
Statistically, the best strategy is to always switch doors after the host reveals a goat. The probability of winning the grand prize by switching is 2/3, while the probability of winning by sticking with the initial choice is 1/3.
Summary of Steps
The contestant picks a door (Door A).
The host opens a different door (Door B or C) to reveal a goat.
The contestant decides whether to stick with their initial choice (Door A) or switch to the remaining unopened door (Door C or B).
The host opens the chosen door to reveal the prize.
Example
Initial Choice: Contestant picks Door 1.
Host's Action: Host opens Door 3 to reveal a goat.
Second Choice: Contestant decides to switch to Door 2.
Reveal: Host opens Door 2 to reveal whether the contestant has won the grand prize or a goat.
By understanding and applying the strategy of switching doors, contestants can improve their chances of winning the Monty Hall game.
